2. find config.py and open it in your ide (its in src folder)

You can add as many as you want but the max_results per query caps off at about 100.

Let it run. It takes time if you have a lot of queries.

NEXT UPDATE (I was pressured to release this one):
- ETR (Estimated Time Remaining) Counter
- GPU Threading for people with high end gpus, because cpu threading is lame
- Condensing all the files into 1 folder because it looks like a mess

IDK WHEN THE UPDATE IS RELEASING LOL BUT THIS WORKS!!!
